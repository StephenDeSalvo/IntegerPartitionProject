             First: zero index value of vector is meaningless or some utility value we may need,
             and arbitrary index I would 1 to 1 correspond with the number of parts of size I.
             
             Second: index from zero like normal, deal with the mental size decrease in all instances
             
             To be determined which is preferable.
