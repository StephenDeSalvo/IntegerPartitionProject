/**
 A class representing a specific, randomized integer partition. A random partition represents a series of multiplicities, which is the count of pieces of a certain size in an integer partition.
 
 For example, if a partition is size 10, the following are valid multiplicity sets:
 
 - 10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 (10 pieces of size 1)
 - 1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0 (1 piece of size 1, 1 piece of size 4, 1 piece of size five)
 - 8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 (8 pieces of size 1, 1 piece of size 2)
 - 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1 (1 piece of size 10).
