Code has been cleaned.

Added Ryan's implementation of Sylvester's bijection, and the function will now output the point data after each transformation.
Due to their enormous size, example point data files have not been uploaded.
In the current main.cpp file, update DSR to some lower value (say, 100 or 10) to speed up the program.

Implemented Pak's basic geometric/arithmetic transform functions.
Added an "id" to the point stuct, which MUST be manually initialized if one wishes to use it, for tracking points.

The main routines of past commits have been stored in their own folder.

Welcome to the combinatorics branch of the Integer Partition Project!

The namespace for the files we provide will be IPC.
This is done in order to differentiate any common function/class/etc. names from other branches.

The IPBInteger.hpp file should not be included anywhere -- it is only for reference, and will be removed in the future.
