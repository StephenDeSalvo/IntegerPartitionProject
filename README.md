Welcome to the combinatorics branch of the Integer Partition Project!

The namespace for the files we provide will be IPC.
This is done in order to differentiate any common function/class/etc. names from other branches.

The IPBInteger.hpp file should not be included anywhere -- it is only for reference, and will be removed in the future.
